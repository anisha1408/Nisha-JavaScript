    <h1>JavaScript Variables </h1>
    <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>JavaScript Identifiers </h1>
    <p>All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.</p>

    <p>These unique names are called identifiers.</p>

    <p>Identifiers can be short names (like x and y), or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).</p>

    <p>The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
        <li>Names must begin with a letter</li>
        <li>Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)</li>
        <li>Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)</li>
        <li>Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names</li>
    </ul>
